        Jack Needs A Job was founded in 2018 for the sole purpose of getting Jack a remote coding job. During his job search for developer positions, he keep running into postings asking for more than just a cover letter and resume. They wanted to see something he had built, so he decided to design this app. While churning through the code at the Nook Cafe, he struck up on a conversation with a University of Houston student and told him about his new project. The guy liked the idea and the name so much, he suggested that after Jack gets a job, he should leave the site up and update it in a way to help others like Jack find jobs as well. Thus, Jack Needs A Job was born.</p>
