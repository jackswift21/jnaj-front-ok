      <h3>ABOUT JACK</h3>
      <p>Houston native. Super cool. Majored in Math at <a href='https://www.morehouse.edu'>Morehouse</a> (2005). Did remote access for Chase Bank for 3 yrs (2008), server configuration for HP (2009) and help desk work for Direct Energy (2014). Attended the <a href='https://freeman.tulane.edu/'>Freeman School of Business at Tulane</a>, got an MBA (2011), got a master of Finance (2012), owe the school money...no transcripts. No transcripts, no corporate job since. Taught high school geometry (2013), and lectured and tutored elementary math (2015-2017).</p>

		  <p>If I haven't lost you yet, here's the beef. In 2015, I made a life-changing decision while between education jobs. After conceiving some great business ideas, I would teach myself to code (using nothing but online tutorials and answers from Stack Overview), and design the needed web/mobile applications to manage and serve those products on my own! Starting with <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp'>HTML</a> and <a href='https://www.javascript.com/'>Javascript</a>, I began the process of remaking myself into a developer. After six months, my needs included backend functionality, so I taught myself PHP and SQL. After six months of working in PHP (didn't like it!), I was ready for a full solution for making an app end to end. I needed an event loop, I needed an api more keen to my true love of JS, and finally I needed to stop creating each and every piece of functionality from scratch (yay <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/'>NPM</a>!!). Enter <a href='https://nodejs.org/'>NodeJS</a> & Express. And <a href='https://www.mongodb.com/'>MongoDB</a> & Mongoose instead of SQL. And <a href='https://angular.io/'>Angular</a> & Javascript with <a href='http://ngrx.github.io/'>Ngrx</a> for the front. For three years, I studied every open source online resource (and even read few library books cover to cover) I could find about Javascript, then Node, then Angular(2+), and used that accumluated knowledge to build my Angular2 application(s).</p>

		  <p>While I am proud that was produced, the hard reality is that real magic happens in teams...and as a one man show, I had yet to produce a live money-making contraption yet. However, my commitment to learning how to code, and then actually fleshing out full stack MEAN applications has been nothing but rewarding. Except for one aspect. No one had paid me for the 8, 10, 12, 14 hr days (almost every day for 24 months) I spent grinding out each module, each component...routes, guards, resolvers, services, actions, reducers, effects, backend routes, middleware and schemas. This commitment was solely produced on sheer will to make an MVP alone and get paid. The cost of this decision has been significant. Now my new found skills must help someone else or it would all have been for naught.
		  </p>

		  <p>So then. Jack needs a job, and i started looking for remote coder positions. But as I begun to explore the market, along with my letters and resume, each posting kept asking for the same thing - a link to something I built. Yet, I still hadn't "built" anything. So I took a few extra weeks to create this app for the world to see what I can do. Now let me do it for you.</p>
