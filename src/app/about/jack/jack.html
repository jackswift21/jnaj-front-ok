     <h3>ABOUT JACK</h3>
     <p>Houston native. Super cool. Majored in Math at <a href='https://www.morehouse.edu'>Morehouse</a> (2005). Did remote access for Chase Bank for 3 yrs (2008), server configuration for HP (2009) and help desk work for Direct Energy (2014). Attended the <a href='https://freeman.tulane.edu/'>Freeman School of Business at Tulane</a> and got an MBA (2011). Taught high school geometry (2013), and lectured elementary math (2015-2017).</p>

	<p>In 2015, I made a life-changing decision while between education jobs. After conceiving some great business ideas, I would teach myself to code (using nothing but online tutorials and answers from Stack Overview), and design the needed web/mobile applications to manage and serve those products on my own! Starting with <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp'>HTML</a> and <a href='https://www.javascript.com/'>Javascript</a>, I began the process of remaking myself into a developer. After six months, my needs included backend functionality, so I taught myself PHP and SQL. After six months of working in PHP (didn't like it!), I was ready for a full solution for making an app end to end. I needed an event loop, I needed an api more keen to my true love of JS, and finally I needed to stop creating each and every piece of functionality from scratch (yay <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/'>NPM</a>!!). Enter <a href='https://nodejs.org/'>NodeJS</a> & Express. And <a href='https://www.mongodb.com/'>MongoDB</a> & Mongoose instead of SQL. And <a href='https://angular.io/'>Angular</a> & Javascript with <a href='http://ngrx.github.io/'>Ngrx</a> for the front. For three years, I studied every open source online resource (and even read few library books cover to cover) I could find about Javascript, then Node, then Angular(2+), and used that accumluated knowledge to build my Angular2 application(s).</p>

	<p>I'm super proud of the work I produced, but the hard reality is that real magic happens in teams...and as a one man show, I had yet to produce a live money-making contraption yet. However, my commitment to learning how to code, and then actually fleshing out full stack MEAN applications has been nothing but rewarding.<p>But right now, Jack needs a job. As I began looking for coding positions, along with my letters and resume, each posting kept asking for the same thing - a link to something I built. Yet, I still hadn't "built" anything, so I took a few extra weeks to create this app for the world to see what I can do. This. Let me do it for you.</p>
